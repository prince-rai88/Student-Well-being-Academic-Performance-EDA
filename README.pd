# 🌟 Student Well-being & Academic Performance EDA

This project explores how **student habits and well-being** influence **academic performance (CGPA)**. Using a dataset of study patterns, sleep, screen time, stress levels, and extracurricular activities, we uncover meaningful trends that can help improve learning outcomes and student life.

## 📁 Project Files

- **`firsttask.csv`** – Original dataset provided for analysis.  
- **`student-wellbeing-eda.py`** – Python script for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  
- **`cleaned_firsttask.csv`** – Cleaned dataset ready for analysis.

## 🛠️ Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Examine dataset structure, missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing and inconsistent records.  
   - Encode categorical variables (Stress Level, Extracurricular Activities).  
   - Prepare clean data for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Investigate correlations between **study hours, sleep, screen time** and CGPA.  
   - Compare academic performance across **stress levels**.  
   - Analyze CGPA differences between students who participate in **extracurricular activities** vs those who don’t.  
   - Visualize patterns using scatter plots, bar charts, and box plots.

4. **Insights**
   - Generate actionable insights supported by graphs and statistics.
